**Project Summary** In this project we will be analyzing seismic data from Mars and Earth. The data from Mars comes from the Elyse station, and the data from Earth comes from The Little Thumb Seismic Station in Yellowstone. Our goal is to successfully interpret and represent the data in order to compare and contrast data trends from the two planets. We will use our findings to identify geological/geophysical similarities and differences between Mars and Earth. 

**How to use this repository** 

**Introduction** When gathering data from two seperate planets we wanted to find the most similar geological locations on each planet possible. The data from Mars came from the Elyse station which is the landing spot for the Mars InSight mission that landed in 2018 and deployed a seismometer to study the planet's interior structure and seismic activity.
