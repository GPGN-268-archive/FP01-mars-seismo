**Project Summary** In this project we will be analyzing seismic data from Mars and Earth. Our goal is to successfully interpret and represent the data in order to compare and contrast data trends from the two planets. We will use our findings to identify geological/geophysical similarities and differences between the two planets.  The data from Mars comes from the Elyse station, and the data from Earth comes from The Little Thumb Seismic Station in Yellowstone.

**Introduction** When gathering data from two seperate planets we wanted to find the most similar geological locations on each planet possible. The data from Mars came from the Elyse station; which is the landing spot for the Mars InSight mission that landed in 2018 and deployed a seismometer to study the planet's interior structure and seismic activity. The landing area, also known as Elysium Planitia, is a field with multiple volcanic constructs. Using this information, and the following topographic map, we begin to look for a location on Earth with similar features.

The data utilzed from Earth was found at Yellowstone and gathered by the Little Thumb Seismic Station. This station sits on the Yellowstone Caldera, which is a volcanic caldera and a hotspot for geothermal activity.

(Descrpition of graphs similarities and differences)

Through our observations of the seismic events being fairly similar on each planet, we can conclude that the geological/geophysical features on the two planets most likely resemble one another. And while there is currently no difinitive evidence of there being a magma chamber under the surface of Mars, using our knowledge of the fact that volcanic activity can cause an increase in earthquakes in the surrounding area, we can infer that the increase of seismic activity around the Elysium Planitita is linked to the presence of a magma chamber under the region.
