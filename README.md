In this project we will be analyzing seismic data on mars, the geology of the most active regions, and comparing it to similar data on Earth.

## Background Information

### Problem Statement
How does seismic data from Mars compare to that of Earth and what can they tell us about geological/geophysical similarities and differences between the two planets?
### Questions/Objectives
- How many quakes occur on average on each planet?
- What is the streghth of these events?
- Are there any hotspots? If so, what are the geologic features of those areas?
- Are there any similarities/differences in the data trends? Why might that be?
